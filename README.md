# kattisrc_pal
A small go CLI/TUI program to keep track of your locally stored kattisrc files

# Why?
This project is created purely as a response to the fantastic [Kitty CLI](https://github.com/avborup/kitty) (no not the terminal emulator but the kattis problem CLI) created by avburop. For this to function with subdomains of kattis you have to change your kattisrc file quite a lot :). Why not make this a more pleasant experience than manually swapping things around
